An excuse to experiment with deploying a Rust webapp using shuttle.rs

Easily balances group outing expenses among friends, so that everybody gets to make the fewest money transfers as possible among one another, just at the end of the outing.

Named after the thing you play badminton with, which is also called a "shuttle" :)
